It practically brought FX into prominence among the other heavy-hitting TV outlets that are usually known for always having the best dramas to offer, season after season.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=581 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>The plot of the show centered around “McNamara/Troy,” a plastic surgery clinic in Miami, headed by two doctors with personal lives that made their work often tougher than once imagined. Clients who wanted to look younger, be “bigger,” or even assist in some kind of drug smuggling ring — yes, really — went under the knife with the expectations of walking out a changed person. The complicated cast of supporting characters in their close circle of friends, family, and colleagues also added to the show’s appeal which lasted over the course of six thrilling seasons.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>The show’s success opened the door for cast members to move on to other projects after the perilous plastic surgeons stopped taking patients in 2010. But after so many touch-and-go exploits, what is the main cast of the show up to now?</p><h3 id=h-dylan-walsh-as-dr-sean-mcnamara data-injectable=false>Dylan Walsh as Dr. Sean McNamara</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DylanWalsh.jpg><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>Walsh was cast as Doctor Sean McNamara after being spotted by popular <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">television</a> producer and series creator Ryan Murphy in a coffee shop. Walsh did have a decent resume before landing what’s still the most popular role in his ongoing career. Before Nip/Tuck, he was a steady actor from the beginning of his career in the late eighties and through the nineties. He appeared in movies like Loverboy, Nobody’s Fool, and Congo, as well as TV shows such as Gabriel’s Fire, Brooklyn South, and The Twilight Zone.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>He continued to take a handful of small roles while playing Dr. McNamara and was able to gain more work from the success of Nip/Tuck after the show’s last episode. Walsh went on to star in Unforgettable, a hit police drama on CBS, for four seasons. His next notable role has been in the ongoing popular CW superhero drama Superman & Lois, as Sam Lane, the father of Lois Lane.</p><h3 id=h-julian-mcmahon-as-dr-christian-troy data-injectable=false>Julian McMahon as Dr. Christian Troy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/JulianMcMahon-1.jpg><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julian McMahon</a></strong>, an Australian-American actor, had started his career in his native Australia before working primarily stateside in 1993 with a regular role on the NBC daytime soap opera Another World, followed by a main role in the crime drama Profiler. He eventually became even more popular by playing Cole Turner for a few seasons on the hit supernatural drama Charmed, just before being cast as the womanizing and risky Dr. Troy of Nip/Tuck.</p><p data-characters=716 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>While working on the show, McMahon was cast as the villainous Doctor Doom in two Fantastic Four movies. After Nip/Tuck was finished, he went on to star in movies like RED, Paranoia, and his most recent film, Monster Party, in 2018. Much like it was prior to Nip/Tuck, McMahon has been busier with his television work since 2010, picking up roles in both Australia and the United States. His most notable roles on the small screen have been as Jonah in Marvel’s Runaways and most recently as FBI Special Agent Jess LaCroix in all three of CBS’ FBI drama storylines. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, he’s rumored to have the role of Thomas Brennan in a western drama titled Justice, which currently has no production schedule.</p><h3 id=h-john-hensley-as-matt-mcnamara data-injectable=false>John Hensley as Matt McNamara</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/JohnHensley.jpg><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=764 data-injectable=true>Actor John Hensley played Matt, the son of Dr. McNamara during all six seasons of the show. He got his start on TV in 1999 with a small role in an episode of the Comedy Central series Strangers With Candy. He then followed that up with another small role a year later in an episode of The Sopranos before landing a main role on the short-lived TNT comic book-action series Witchblade. Then, in 2003, came his most notable work to date after being cast in Nip/Tuck.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>Hensley did also take some small roles in a number of independent comedies and horror films while working on the show. And after the show came to an end, he landed some guest roles on some popular shows like Sons of Anarchy, The Mentalist, a recurring role in How to Get Away with Murder, and 9-1-1. He last appeared in another recurring role on the hit CBS action-drama NCIS.</p><h3 id=h-joely-richardson-as-julia-mcnamara data-injectable=false>Joely Richardson as Julia McNamara</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/JoelyRichardson.jpg><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>English actress Joely Richardson portrayed Juila, the troubled wife of Dr. McNamara throughout the entire course of the series.
